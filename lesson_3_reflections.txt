When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository would be useful for working with other people, who may or may not be colocated. It's also useful for accessing from multiple locations for yourself, and for keeping a backup. It also is easy to make public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually prevents Git from trying to sync with a remote repository, which might lead to problems with commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A fork copies a repository on GitHub and keeps a record of it's owner. It also acts like a new repository from which to work from. Clones are like a copy of a repository, but they don't give credit to the original. And a branch is a string of changes to a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Internet access is not needed for updates becuase the last known state is stored locally.
