Using diff made it so that I did not have to manually compare every line
Instead the computer compared the bulk of lines and only showed me ones with a difference


Instead of spending lots of time hunting for bugs in code, 
easy access to the entire history of a file could save me time debugging
lots of time over a lifetime

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The commits are meaningful because they can have a short description and have been intentional by the user.
Unfortunately, user error can also contribute to a lack of commit when it might have been useful.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git organizes related files into a project and allows one to save them all as a commit since they are interrelated. Changes between GoogleDocs are usually unrelated between files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the history of the commits while git diff compares two files and their changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Version control would allow me to easily undo problems that I contributed to breaking something.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
This course first. And then a personal project using urban data from USC.
