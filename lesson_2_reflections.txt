When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created without any commits in it. It is a necessary step so that commits can be stored somewhere.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is not stored long term. It offers the ability to keep something until it is ready to be saved as a commit. If it isn't that important, it never is.
